As you can see below, I made 3 different visuals for this challenge. The first being a horizontal bar chart that is editable, the second being a bubble chart, and the third being a gauge chart. I was able to complete all the steps except for the bubble chart which was giving me trouble with the colors. After the charts were made, I creates a CSS style sheet to change font color, font style, and add in an image to make the page look more interesting.
